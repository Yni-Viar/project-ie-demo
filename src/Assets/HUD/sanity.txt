/!\ I AM NOT A LAWYER, IANAL.

Sanity system was a patented mechanic by Nintendo.
As I thought, this patent was active only in US and Australia.

2021-11-05
Adjusted expiration
Status
Expired - Lifetime (https://patents.google.com/patent/US6935954B2/en)

So, I think you can use this mechanic without any troubles, because patent was expired in 2021.
(through this demo does not use this mechanic, this sanitybar.png was left from TGPY code, 
I left this as a reminder (mostly for myself))
